## Status reports

- Continue working on the ecosystem ("zoo") chapter

### Jan
- Wrote instructions for installing Sage
- Will primarily act as a reviewer for content written by others

### Mirco
- Spent a total of cca. 5 weeks on the MMM
- Written the bulk of the "Number Theory" chapter
- Created super simple curve with only 13 elements to be used for excercises
- Happy to work a few hours on the MMM parallel to audits that are less intense

### Steve
- Has been writing up "Pairings", will continue fleshing it out

### Sylvia
- No significant involvement at the stage apart from minor typesetting/editing



## Agreements

- The value of the MMM is more than just the funding we get for it, so it makes sense to continue the work.
- The team has clear tasks to complete, and happy with the intensity/timing of the work on MMM/reconciling this with their auditing responsibilities.
- Estimation for finishing 1st draft: end of July.
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6061b4073b270f74b95100ad) integration will be deprioritized, since it doesn't support [SageTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/sagetex?lang=en), and the added value of SageTeX outweighs the potential benefit of WYSIWYG editing in Overleaf.<br>  To preserve the possibility of using Overleaf, we'll define our own commands/environments to be used for SageTeX parts. These commands/environments can be redefined to `comment` if we want to typeset the document without SageMath in Overleaf.
- Examples should use the super-simple curve created my Mirco whereever possible.
