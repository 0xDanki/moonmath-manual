Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are an important privacy-enhancing tool from cryptography. Theyallow proving the veracity of a statement, related to confidential data, without revealing any in-formation beyond the validity of the statement. ZKPs were initially developed by the academiccommunity in the 1980s, and have seen tremendous improvements since then. They are now ofpractical feasibility in multiple domains of interest to the industry, and to a large community ofdevelopers and researchers. ZKPs can have a positive impact in industries, agencies, and for per-sonal use, by allowing privacy-preserving applications where designated private data can be madeuseful to third parties, despite not being disclosed to them. 

ZKP systems involve at least two parties: a prover and a verifier. The goal of the prover is toconvince the verifier that a statement is true, without revealing any additional information. Forexample, suppose the prover holds a birth certificate digitally signed by an authority. In orderto access some service, the prover may have to prove being at least 18 years old, that is, thatthere exists a birth certificate, tied to the identify of the prover and digitally signed by a trustedcertification authority, stating a birthdate consistent with the age claim. A ZKP allows this, withoutthe prover having to reveal the birthdate.
